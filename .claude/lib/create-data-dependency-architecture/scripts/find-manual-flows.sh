# find-manual-flows.sh — Phase 2 discovery floor for the
# create-data-dependency-architecture skill.
#
# Scans every .txt file under <input-folder>/output/extracted-text/ for a fixed
# list of manual-flow phrases and writes <input-folder>/output/manual-flow-candidates.txt
# with one line per match, sorted by filename then line number, so the file is
# byte-stable across re-runs against the same extracted text.
#
# The phrase list below is the SINGLE source of truth for "what counts as a
# manual-copy signal". Adding a phrase is a one-line edit; the spec
# (data-dependency-discovery) requires at least the 23 phrases shipped here.
#
# Usage:
#   find-manual-flows.sh <input-folder>
#
# Exits non-zero if <input-folder>/output/extracted-text/ does not exist or
# contains no .txt files.
