# JI as-is database schema — diagrams

Schema diagrams reverse-engineered from `JI Tables - 1.pdf` (the Oracle DDL dump of the legacy JI APEX database).

## Scope

- **46 production tables** (`TBL_*`) from the source PDF
- **0 explicit foreign-key constraints** — APEX pattern. All relationships in the diagrams are inferred from column-naming conventions and labelled by confidence
- **24 triggers** — predominantly `BI_*` (auto-PK from sequence) and `BU_*` (audit timestamp maintenance)
- **26 indexes** (non-PK)
- **6 production tables without declared PK** — backfilled from unique `*_PK` indexes where present
- **TMP_* staging tables excluded** by design — they're session-scoped, not part of the schema

### Source

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`JI Tables - 1.pdf`](JI%20Tables%20-%201.pdf) | Original Oracle DDL dump from APEX |

### Build pipeline

| Script | Role |
|---|---|
| [`scripts/python/parse_ji_ddl.py`](https://github.com/hmcts/ram-analysis/blob/main/scripts/python/parse_ji_ddl.py) | Parses `JI_Tables_1.txt` → `ji_schema.json` |
| [`scripts/python/build_schema_diagram.py`](https://github.com/hmcts/ram-analysis/blob/main/scripts/python/build_schema_diagram.py) | Loads JSON → infers FKs + clusters → generates Graphviz DOT → renders PNG → writes companion markdown |

## How to read the diagrams

### Overview (`ji_schema_overview.png`)

- **Each box is an area cluster** containing the list of its tables. Numbers in parentheses after each table name are column counts. Trigger badges `[BI BU…]` appear after tables with triggers.
- **Arrows between boxes** are inter-area aggregate FK relationships. The label is the count of inferred FKs crossing the area boundary; line weight scales with the count.
- **No per-table edges**. To see column-level FKs, open the relevant per-area detail PNG.

### Detail diagrams (per area)

Every detail PNG includes a built-in legend.

- **Tables are laid out in a grid** of ~√N tables per row to spread the diagram horizontally rather than stacking.
- **Header bar**: `TBL_NAME` + trigger badges (e.g. `[BI BU]` = before-insert + before-update); next row shows the PK columns.
- **Column rows** list every column with type and inline markers.
- **Column markers**:
  - `PK` — primary key
  - `FK` — foreign key, **target is in the same area** (line is drawn)
  - `UK` — unique key (from a `*_UK` named index)
  - `NN` — NOT NULL
- **Italicised column name + `→ TBL_NAME` marker** — the column references a table in **another area**. **No edge is drawn** (open the named area's detail diagram, or the overview, to see the relationship visually).
- **Italicised column name + italic hint** (e.g. `→ LOCATIONS / OFFICES`) — the column references a table **not in the source PDF**. See `ji_schema_companion.md` for the full external-reference inventory.
- **Edge styles** (intra-area lines only):
  - Solid blue — **HIGH** confidence FK (exact PK match)
  - Dashed grey — **MEDIUM** confidence FK (prefixed PK match, e.g. `START_SITTING_DUR_ID` → `SITTING_DUR_ID`)

## Notable findings

- **`TBL_JUDGES` is the central hub** — referenced by ~16 tables via `JUDGE_CODE`. Sits in the *Judges Profile* cluster.
- **No explicit FK constraints anywhere** — typical for APEX-managed schemas where referential integrity is enforced at the application layer. This means the database itself permits orphaned rows.
- **Composite link tables** in *Reference Data* (`TBL_JI_LOC_JT_*_LINKS`) connect Location × Judge Type to Work / Sitting Duration controlled lists.
- **6 tables ship without explicit PK** in the DDL but do have unique `*_PK` indexes that effectively serve as PKs: `TBL_JUDGES`, `TBL_JUDGE_TYPES`, `TBL_JUDGE_CIRCUITS`, `TBL_JUDGE_COURTS_LINK`, plus two that have *neither* PK nor `*_PK` index: `TBL_JUDGE_TYPE_PROMOTION` and `TBL_JUDGES_MONTHLY_STATS`. The latter two are flagged in the diagrams as "(no PK declared)".
- **External-reference columns** account for 58 inferred relationships pointing to tables not in this PDF: locations (`LOC_ID`, `LOC_TYPE_ID`, `BASE_LOC_*`, `HEARING_LOC_*`), regions (`REGION_ID`), courtrooms (`CUT_*`), courts (`COURT_ID`), and several status/lookup columns. See the companion markdown for the full list.
