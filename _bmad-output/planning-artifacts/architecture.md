## Project Context Analysis

### Requirements Overview

**Functional Requirements (61, in 9 capability areas).** NJI is 11 services (revised v2.2 — `nji-configuration` dropped; per-service config in Spring profiles + Key Vault; a shared `configuration_values` table holds cross-service policy values), in three clusters:

- **Domain services** — Judge, Absence, Vacancy, Booking, Sitting, Payment. Operational chain: Manage Judges → Absence → Vacancy → Booking → Sitting → Payment → Reconciliation.
- **Cross-cutting services** — Reference Data (single writer), Authorisation (gates every call), Notification (transactional email).
- **Read-model services** — Itinerary, MI Feed. Both use SQL JOINs over the shared database.

Architectural implications:

- **One synchronous cross-service write**: `POST /bookings` marks the vacancy filled in the same transaction (FR30, R5) — direct UPDATE on `vacancies.filled` per Principle 1. Retry safety: `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` + `uq_bookings_*` unique constraint.
- **Read-model federation**: SQL JOINs over the shared schema. Indexed joins meet the Forward Look NFR (≤ 30 s p95, NFR8).
- **Working-pattern sitting generation** (FR13, FR35): owned by Judge; produces records that Sitting manages from Phase 5 onwards.
- **Versioned content-type for Payment** (FR44 — `application/vnd.hmcts.jfeps+json` vs `+xlsx`). JFEPS shape is externally owned.
- **Per-service authorisation** (FR2, NFR13): every API call resolves principal → role + Region/Area scope through Authorisation. Implemented as middleware.

**Non-Functional Requirements (42, in 8 categories):**

- **Performance** — page-level: ≤ 5 s dashboard, ≤ 30 s reports/Forward Look (APEX baseline). API: ≤ 500 ms p95 read, ≤ 1 s p95 write. Capacity ~50–100/region; ~200–500 national.
- **Security** — TLS only; encryption at rest; AuthN via HMCTS IdP SSO; AuthZ owned by NJI; no bank details, no case-level data; aligned with GFS-7.
- **Accessibility** — WCAG 2.2 AA; tested per UI page per phase.
- **Integration** — OIDC issuer (mock auth Phase 0–8; HMCTS IdP from pre-Phase-9); JFEPS/Liberata unchanged; HMCTS email; DA&I MI Feed; no eLinks integration in MVP.
- **Observability** — log-based MVP only (D7); structured logs + correlation IDs; OpenTelemetry → Application Insights.
- **Data privacy & sovereignty** — Azure UK regions only; UK GDPR + DPA 2018; no case-level data.
- **Reliability** — available during HMCTS hours; per-wave rollback; single Azure region (UK South) with multi-AZ HA; HMCTS-judicial-region rollout isolation at the app tier via FR58 flags. DR is an **open gap** — see [`./architecture/gaps.md` G3.6](./architecture/gaps.md).
- **Maintainability** — API-as-Product (versioned, OpenAPI, [RFC 9457](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9457) problem-details); per-service deployment; manual UAT scripts per domain service (FR61 / NFR41); Postman collections per phase.

**Scale & complexity:** 11-service API backend + UI. Complexity drivers: JFEPS/Liberata payment integration, cross-cutting authorisation, multi-region phased rollout, judicial regulatory environment, manual UAT against APEX.

### Technical Constraints & Dependencies

**Locked from PRD:**

- **Stack:** Java 25 (LTS) + Spring Boot 4 + Kubernetes + Microsoft Azure (UK regions only).
- **Coordination:** REST-first synchronous; no event stream, no message bus, no webhook fabric.
- **Read-model strategy:** SQL JOINs over the shared schema; no API federation, no cache fallback.
- **Identity:** OIDC issuer (mock auth Phase 0–8; HMCTS IdP from pre-Phase-9 cutover); JI owns Authorisation; password/session/account lifecycle external.
- **Data residency:** Azure UK regions only (no personal data leaves the UK).
- **No bank details, no case-level data** anywhere by contract.
- **No automated eLinks/HR integration** in MVP scope.

**External systems (not controlled by NJI):**

- **HMCTS IdP** — pre-Phase-9 hard dependency; mock auth covers Phase 0–8.
- **JFEPS-compatible Excel format** for Payment — externally owned; treated as a versioned content-type.
- **HMCTS email infrastructure** for transactional notifications.
- **DA&I MI Feed consumers** (post-MVP) — they call NJI APIs.
- **APEX** — used by UAT users to compare behaviour. No programmatic linkage to NJI's CI or runtime.

**Migration (Phase 0 only):** Reference Data + Users/Roles from APEX (D3 + D9). No transactional data. APEX ⇄ IdP reconciliation: every active APEX user reconciles to an IdP principal; unmatched records get explicit handling (drop / hold / manual map).

### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified

Concerns that recur across most services and are addressed at the platform layer:

- **Authorisation enforcement** — every API call resolves principal → roles + Region/Area scope through Authorisation (FR2, FR3). Implemented as middleware.
- **Reference Data is single-writer** — sole source of truth for Regions, Offices, vocabularies, calendar (FR6, FR7). Reads: direct SQL on the 15 Reference Data tables (no caching per Principle 2). Writes: via the Reference Data API.
- **Per-region scoping** — domain operations default-scope by Region/Area from the Authorisation context (FR49). Cross-region operations are explicit.
- **Per-region phased activation** — per D8, NJI access is gated by `auth_user_activation_flags` (FR58). Authorisation distinguishes "active in NJI" from "exists in NJI".
- **Retry safety via native DB primitives** — `uq_*` unique constraints, JPA `@Version` optimistic locking, `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` pessimistic locks. No `*_idempotency_keys` tables. See [`./architecture/conventions.md`](./architecture/conventions.md) → "Retry safety and concurrency control".
- **API-as-Product compliance** — versioned contract, [RFC 9457](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9457) problem-details, OpenAPI per service (FR59).
- **Manual UAT** (FR61 / NFR41) — APEX-experienced users compare NJI vs APEX per service per region; sign-off is the wave-cutover gate. No automated APEX-comparison in CI.
- **Forbidden data** — no bank details (FR47); no case-level data (FR54). Enforced at the schema and API boundary.

### Architecture-phase decisions still open

The PRD lists 12 TBDs. 5 are programme-management decisions (capacity, ops hours, pilot region, cross-region wave handling, migration owners) — tracked in the PRD risk register, not here. The 7 architecture-phase decisions resolved here:

| # | TBD | Step where resolved |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Rate limit policy | Step 4 (API & Communication) |
| 2 | UI framework family | Step 4 (Frontend Architecture) |
| 3 | Service-to-service authentication mechanism | Step 4 (Authentication & Security) |
| 4 | Log retention period | Step 4 (Infrastructure & Deployment) |
| 5 | API versioning specifics | Step 4 (API & Communication) |
| 6 | Historical-data access policy | Step 4 (Infrastructure & Deployment) |
| 7 | APEX ⇄ IdP identity-key scheme | Step 4 (Authentication & Security) |

## Starter Template Evaluation

### Foundational Principles

#### Principle 1: API for Workflows, Shared Database for Simple Data Access

**APIs are the boundary for workflows. The shared database is the integration mechanism for simple cross-service reads and writes.**

- **Workflows go via API** — multi-step operations with business rules, state transitions, or orchestration (Booking creation, Payment processing, Absence approval).
- **Single-field cross-service updates can be direct DB writes** — e.g. Booking marks `vacancies.filled = true`; Payment updates `bookings.payment_status`. Each owning service grants which tables/columns other services may write via explicit DB role grants.
- **Cross-service reads are direct SQL JOINs** — Itinerary, MI Feed, and Reference Data reads query the shared schema directly. No API fan-out, no cache.

The database is **one global PostgreSQL instance with a single shared schema**. Cross-service access is gated by **per-service DB roles with explicit grants**. Table ownership is encoded in the table name (entity-plural for primary tables; service-prefix for service-internal) and enforced by ArchUnit fitness functions in CI.

**Why one schema, not schema-per-service:** 11 services, one team, one domain. Schema-per-service costs 11 schemas + grants + cross-schema FK overhead + per-PR coordination, with no concrete benefit at MVP. One schema supports the same DB-level access control via per-service roles.

**Why per-service DB roles, not one shared role:** per-service roles are the seam for any future schema-per-service or service extraction. ~10 minutes/role on Day 1; expensive to retrofit. They also give defense-in-depth (a Sitting repo can't write to Payment tables — DB rejects), DB-layer signal for the post-MVP user-action audit (D7), and a reversible decision (start broad, tighten as patterns become visible).

**No shared runtime code library.** Each service owns its own cross-cutting concerns, even at the cost of boilerplate. **Changing a cross-cutting concern in one service never forces redeployment of any other** (NFR40).

What is shared:

- **The PostgreSQL database** (one instance, one schema, per-service roles with explicit grants).
- **API contracts** — OpenAPI specs, [RFC 9457](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9457) envelope, content-type negotiation. Specification, not runtime code.
- **API spec Maven artefacts** — `uk.gov.hmcts.nji:api-nji-{service}:{version}`. Contract, not runtime code.
- **Runtime infrastructure services** (Authorisation, Reference Data, Notification) — by API call (workflows) or direct DB read (simple lookups).
- **Scaffolding templates** (HMCTS Crime SpringBoot template) — at scaffold time, then forked.
- **CI/CD and operational conventions** (Gradle idioms, OpenTelemetry → Application Insights ingestion contract, Flyway baseline) — by convention and tooling, not library.

Duplicated per service: custom `JWTFilter`; `@ControllerAdvice` ([RFC 9457](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9457) + retry-safety status mapping); structured-logging config. ~300–500 lines per service × 11 services. The HMCTS starter encodes most of it.

#### Principle 2: No Premature Optimisation

**Performance optimisations are added when measurement justifies them.** At MVP:

- No Reference Data cache — direct SELECT from the 15 Reference Data tables.
- No distributed cache (Redis).
- No service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) — Spring Security + AKS DNS + JWTFilter are sufficient.
- No read replicas — one PostgreSQL instance is adequate at this scale.
- No async messaging — REST-first synchronous is the default.

Each is added only when measurement shows a need.

### Primary Technology Domain

API backend: Java + Spring Boot 4 on AKS in Azure UK regions. 11 independently-deployable Spring Boot services, each scaffolded once from the HMCTS starter and owned independently. UI framework is a separate decision (Step 4 Frontend Architecture).

### Starter Options & Selection

| Option | Verdict |
|---|---|
| **HMCTS internal Java/Spring Boot starter** (`hmcts/service-hmcts-crime-springboot-template`) | ✅ **Selected.** Confirmed via review (2026-05-06). Encodes Logstash JSON logging, health checks, OpenTelemetry → App Insights, IdP integration patterns (custom `JWTFilter`), and security defaults. **Helm chart and Spring Cloud Azure Key Vault are not in the template baseline** — NJI scaffolding script adds them (G1.4a, G1.4b). |
| **Spring Initializr** | Fallback only. Same per-service-fork model; HMCTS-specific patterns added manually. |
| **JHipster** | ❌ Rejected. Heavyweight; bundles identity/frontend/database/Docker conflicting with locked decisions. |
| **Spring Cloud Microservices archetype** | ❌ Rejected. Service discovery / config server / circuit breakers — not needed under REST-first synchronous + Kubernetes. |
| **Custom NJI Platform Library** | ❌ Rejected on the no-shared-runtime-library principle. |

**Why the HMCTS starter:** scaffold-time inheritance, not runtime dependency. Each service is forked at scaffold time and owns its own copy from then on. Consistent with the foundational principles.

### Initialisation Flow, Build Tool, Dependency Inventory, Per-service Conventions

See [`./architecture/starter-template.md`](./architecture/starter-template.md).

## Core Architectural Decisions

### Decision Priority Analysis

**Critical (block implementation):** Database technology + table-ownership/per-service-role model · Service-to-service authentication mechanism · API versioning · UI framework · API gateway / rate-limiting layer.

**Important (shape architecture):** Migration tooling for schema changes · APEX ⇄ IdP identity-key scheme · Log retention · Historical-data access policy · HA topology (single Azure region multi-AZ in UK South; HMCTS-judicial-region rollout isolation at application tier). DR scope is an open gap — see [`./architecture/gaps.md` G3.6](./architecture/gaps.md).

**Deferred (post-MVP per Principle 2):** Reference Data caching · Distributed cache (Redis) · Service mesh · Read replicas · APIM advanced features.

### Data Architecture

**Database:** PostgreSQL on Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server, UK regions only. Version 17 (16 acceptable if HMCTS prefers). Reasons: relational domain; mature; lower-cost than Azure SQL; HMCTS open-source preference.

**Topology:** one global instance, one shared schema, per-service DB roles.

- **One PostgreSQL Flexible Server instance** (not per-region, not per-service); sized for the full user population.
- **One logical database**, one shared schema (e.g. `nji`).
- **Table ownership** encoded by table name (below) + per-service DB roles with explicit grants (below).

**Table naming and ownership:**

- **Primary domain tables** — entity-plural, no prefix: `judges`, `absences`, `vacancies`, `bookings`, `sittings`, `payments`, `payment_schedules`, `regions`, `offices`, `calendar_periods`, plus the 12 vocabulary tables.
- **Service-internal or ambiguous tables** — service-prefixed: `payment_reconciliations`, `notification_dispatches`, `auth_user_roles`.
- **Ownership table** in [`./architecture/data-tables.md`](./architecture/data-tables.md).
- **The team that writes the Flyway migration creating the table owns it.** The `V*__*.sql` lives in the owning service's repo.

**ArchUnit fitness functions in CI:**

- No two services' migrations create overlapping tables.
- DB role grants match the documented ownership.
- Each service's role has full privileges on its own tables, and only explicitly-granted privileges on others.

**Cross-service access:**

| Access pattern | Allowed | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Service reads its own tables | ✅ Always | Spring Data JPA |
| Service writes its own tables | ✅ Always | Spring Data JPA |
| Service reads another service's tables | ✅ For SELECT-granted | Direct SQL JOIN; no API roundtrip |
| Service writes a single field on another service's table | ✅ For UPDATE-granted columns | Direct UPDATE in writer's transaction; pessimistic row lock recommended |
| Service performs a workflow on another service's data | ❌ Direct DB; ✅ via API | Owning service's REST endpoint |
| Service writes non-granted columns/tables | ❌ Forbidden | DB rejects |

**Foreign keys within the shared schema** are allowed and encouraged (e.g. `bookings.judge_id REFERENCES judges(id)`).

**Per-service DB roles with explicit grants** — `nji_judge`, `nji_booking`, etc. (one per service; `nji_mock_auth` for dev/integration). `ALL` privileges on owned tables. Cross-table access granted explicitly: `GRANT SELECT ON vacancies TO nji_booking; GRANT UPDATE (filled, filled_at) ON vacancies TO nji_booking;`. Grants live in Flyway migrations owned by the table-owning service. **Day 1: grants start broad, tighten as patterns become visible.**

**Forward compatibility:** per-service DB roles are the seam for future schema-per-service or service-extraction without connection-layer code changes.

**Data modelling:** Spring Data JPA + Hibernate. Per-service entities, repositories, and queries. No shared entity classes. Another service's whitelisted tables are `@Immutable` JPA entities in the consuming service.

**Schema evolution: Flyway** (`spring-boot-starter-flyway`, `flyway-core`, `flyway-database-postgresql`). Per-service `src/main/resources/db/migration/V*__*.sql`. Migrations run on application startup. **Flyway is for NJI's DDL only — not for loading APEX data into NJI** (see Phase 0 ETL below).

**Phase 0 Data Migration from APEX (separate from Flyway):**

- **Source:** APEX SQL dumps for Reference Data and APEX user records + role/scope assignments. NJI does not own or constrain APEX's schema.
- **Target:** NJI tables — `regions`, `offices`, `calendar_periods`, the 12 vocabulary tables, `auth_users`, `auth_roles`, `auth_user_roles`, `auth_user_region_scopes`, `auth_user_activation_flags`.
- **Mechanism:** the migration tool reads APEX dumps, transforms each row to NJI shape, and loads via NJI APIs (`POST /v1/regions`, `POST /authz/users`, etc.). The API is the seeding mechanism; the migration tool is the bulk caller.
- **Not Flyway data-seeding.** APEX shape ≠ NJI shape; the transform is in code. Writes go via the API so validation, idempotency, and audit-logging hooks fire.
- **Location:** `nji-architecture/migration/` (CLI/script). Phase 0 deliverable; re-runnable per rollout wave.
- **Scope:** Reference Data (D3) + active APEX users with role/Region-Area scope (D9). No transactional data.
- **Reconciliation:** Reference Data lists signed off by RSU/judicial-team owners (Risk #13); every migrated user reconciled against an IdP principal; unmatched records get drop/hold/manual map handling (Risk #14).
- **APEX revalidation:** when the APEX SQL dump lands, validate the tool's APEX-side input mapping. Confirms the tool covers every APEX field NJI needs; does not reshape NJI's tables. New APEX vocabulary values are inserted via the Reference Data API. Tracked as G4.6 / A33.

**Read models:** SQL JOINs across the shared schema. Itinerary and MI Feed run joins across `judges`, `absences`, `vacancies`, `bookings`, `sittings`, `payments` (read-only via SELECT grants). Indexed joins meet the ≤ 30 s Forward Look NFR (NFR8).

**Caching:** none at MVP (per Principle 2). Added per-service post-MVP if measurement shows the need.

**Validation:** JSR-380 (Bean Validation 3.0) on request DTOs and entity fields, enforced by Spring Web's `@Valid`.

### Authoritative Table Ownership Mapping

See [`./architecture/data-tables.md`](./architecture/data-tables.md). The fitness function checks that every Flyway-created table appears there with the correct owning service.

### Authentication & Security

#### Phasing of Authentication: Mock-First, Real IdP Later

Phases 0–8 use `nji-mock-auth`. Real HMCTS IdP integration is a pre-Phase-9 deliverable — a configuration cutover.

**`nji-mock-auth` (Phase 0 deliverable):**

- OIDC `authorization_code` flow for human users (`/oauth2/authorize`, `/oauth2/token`, `/oauth2/jwks`, `/oauth2/userinfo`).
- OAuth `client_credentials` grant for batch service principals (initially `nji-payment-batch`).
- JWTs for a fixed roster of test users covering all 11 user roles × representative Region/Area combinations.
- User roster mirrors what the Phase 0 dev/CI scripts seed into NJI Authorisation.
- Spring Authorization Server. Deployed to AKS dev/integration alongside other Phase 0 services.
- **Production safeguard:** refuses to start with the `production` Spring profile. CI lint blocks production manifests that reference the mock-auth issuer URL.

**Environments:** local dev, CI, unit and integration tests use mock auth. Integration and staging run on mock until the pre-Phase-9 cutover. Production runs on real HMCTS IdP only.

**Why mock-first:** decouples NJI build from the HMCTS IdP team's roadmap; lets developers work without IdP credentials. Reduces Risk #6 (IdP integration timing) from a Phase 0 blocker to a pre-Phase-9 prerequisite.

**Real HMCTS IdP cutover (pre-Phase-9):**

- **Triggers:** G1.1 (HMCTS IdP supports OIDC for human authN), G1.2 (HMCTS IdP supports `client_credentials` for batch — or an alternative per G7.1), G1.3 (principal export/query API for migration reconciliation).
- **Mechanism:** Spring profile flip. Every service's OIDC `issuer-url` switches from mock auth to HMCTS IdP. No code change.
- **Migration:** Phase 0 ETL keys user records by email + employee number, which are issuer-agnostic.
- **Reconciliation:** before staging cutover, a verification job confirms every migrated user maps to a real IdP principal.
- **Test suite:** every automated suite (unit, Testcontainers integration, contract) and per-service manual UAT must pass against real IdP in staging before Phase 9 pilot.

#### End-user Authentication

End-user authentication: OIDC. End-user authorisation: NJI Authorisation service.

Each service runs a custom `JWTFilter` (HMCTS Crime template pattern, `io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt`):

1. Validate JWT signature and issuer against the issuer's JWKS (mock auth in Phase 0–8; HMCTS IdP from pre-Phase-9). Public keys cached per the issuer's cache headers.
2. Extract principal identity (sub, email, employee number) from JWT claims.
3. Call `POST /authz/check` against NJI Authorisation for roles + Region/Area scope + activation flag (FR58). NJI's authz state lives in Authorisation, not the IdP — this differs from the template's claims-only approach.
4. Store the result in a request-scoped `AuthDetails` bean.

The filter caches authorisation decisions for the request lifecycle only.

#### Inter-service Authentication

Two patterns at MVP:

**Pattern 1 — JWT propagation** (user-initiated cross-service calls):

- The upstream service's outbound HTTP client copies the inbound `Authorization: Bearer <user-jwt>` header onto the outbound call. The downstream service's `JWTFilter` validates the same JWT against the IdP's JWKS and resolves authz via `POST /authz/check`.
- Implementation: per-service Spring Boot 4 `RestClient` interceptor (~10 lines). See [`./architecture/conventions.md`](./architecture/conventions.md) → "JWT propagation".

**Pattern 2 — Service-principal authentication** (batch / scheduled components without an upstream user):

- The case at MVP is `nji-payment-batch` — runs on a schedule, picks up bookings ready for payment, generates the JFEPS Excel, dispatches via Notification.
- Authenticates via OAuth 2.0 `client_credentials` against the OIDC issuer. `nji-mock-auth` in Phase 0–8; production issuer per [`./architecture/gaps.md` G7.1](./architecture/gaps.md) (default recommendation: Azure Workload Identity).
- Service token attached as `Authorization: Bearer <service-token>` on outbound calls. The receiving service's `JWTFilter` validates via the same JWKS path as human JWTs.
- Service-principal records live in `auth_users` (with a `principal_kind` flag); `nji-authorisation` resolves their permissions the same way. Registrations live in `mock_oauth_clients` at MVP.

**Other non-runtime auth:** Phase 0 dev/CI seeding via one-off scripts (no runtime API call); Phase 0 production data migration via operator-initiated ETL with the operator's user JWT (G4.7 — flagged for post-MVP refinement).

**Resolves PRD TBD #3:** JWT propagation for user-initiated calls; service principals (mock-auth in non-prod) for the payment batch; production issuer per G7.1.

#### Identity-key Scheme

**APEX ⇄ IdP: email primary, employee number fallback.** (Resolves PRD TBD #7.) During the Phase 0 ETL: match by email; fall back to employee number; flag unmatched for manual review. The reconciliation report is a Phase 0 deliverable (Risk #14 mitigation).

#### API Security Strategy

- TLS-only on every endpoint; HTTP rejected at the ingress layer.
- Custom `JWTFilter` order: ① TLS / header normalisation ② JWT signature + issuer validation ③ `POST /authz/check` ④ populate `AuthDetails` ⑤ business logic.
- Secret management: Azure Key Vault via Spring Cloud Azure Key Vault (startup-time + actuator `/actuator/refresh`).

**Encryption:** TLS 1.3 minimum (TLS 1.2 fallback acceptable); Azure-managed encryption keys for PostgreSQL by default; CMK only if HMCTS security policy requires.

### API & Communication Patterns

**API style: REST-first synchronous.** No event bus, no message queue, no webhook fabric.

**API versioning: URI prefix major versioning. (Resolves PRD TBD #5.)** `/v1/judges`, `/v2/judges`. Backwards-compatible additions stay within the major version. Deprecation signalling: `Deprecation` header per [RFC 9745](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9745) (date-stamp value, e.g. `Deprecation: @1735689600`) + `Sunset` header per [RFC 8594](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8594) (RFC-date value); minimum 6-month internal / 12-month external window before removal.

**Build / version metadata** is served by Spring Boot Actuator's `/actuator/info` (populated by `gradle-git-properties`), ops-restricted at the APIM layer. The OpenAPI spec is the consumer-facing contract.

**Rate limiting: Azure API Management at ingress. (Resolves PRD TBD #1.)** 100 req/sec/principal default; 10 req/sec/principal for MI Feed; 200 req/sec burst (sliding 1-second window). The `429 Too Many Requests` status code is per [RFC 6585](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6585); the `Retry-After` response header is per [RFC 9110 §10.2.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-10.2.3).

**Error handling:** [RFC 9457](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9457) problem-details (`application/problem+json`). Per-service `@ControllerAdvice` converts domain exceptions. Standard `type` URIs: `/errors/validation`, `/errors/authorisation`, `/errors/business-rule`, `/errors/dependency`, `/errors/conflict`. Correlation ID echoed in the response.

**API documentation:** Swagger Core. Each service's OpenAPI 3.x spec is published as a Maven artefact (`uk.gov.hmcts.nji:api-nji-{service}:{version}`); consumers pull it at compile time. Postman collections per phase derived from the spec (FR42 / NFR42). The artefact is contract, not runtime code.

**Service-to-service communication:** REST over HTTPS. Service discovery via Kubernetes DNS (`http://nji-judge.{namespace}.svc.cluster.local:8080`). No service mesh. Synchronous workflows only. Retry safety via native DB primitives (unique constraints + `@Version` + `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`).

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework:** React 18.x + TypeScript 5.x. (Resolves PRD TBD #2.) Common in HMCTS applications; aligns with `govuk-react`.

**Component library:** GOV.UK Design System — required for WCAG 2.2 AA (NFR17).

**State management:** TanStack Query for server state; Zustand or React Context for UI state; React Hook Form for form state (pairs with JSR-380 backend validation via OpenAPI-generated clients).

**Routing:** React Router 6.x.

**API client:** generated per backend service from the OpenAPI spec (`openapi-typescript-codegen` or `orval`). Generated clients live in the UI repo and are regenerated in UI CI. No shared client library across services.

**Build tool:** Vite 5.x.

**Styling:** GOV.UK Design System CSS (Sass-compiled). Per-component CSS modules for extensions. No Tailwind.

**Testing:** Vitest (unit) + React Testing Library (components) + Playwright (E2E, one suite per phase) + axe-core (accessibility).

**Performance:** route-based code splitting via `React.lazy` + Suspense. Vite tree-shaking and minification. No PWA at MVP.

### Infrastructure & Deployment

**Hosting:** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), single cluster in UK South, multi-AZ node pools. Pod anti-affinity (`topology.kubernetes.io/zone`) distributes replicas across AZs. Min 2 replicas/service; HPA tunes upward. HMCTS-judicial-region rollout isolation is enforced at the app tier via FR58 flags, not infrastructure. DR is an open gap — see [`./architecture/gaps.md` G3.6](./architecture/gaps.md).

**Database hosting:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server. One global instance, zone-redundant HA in UK South — primary in one AZ, standby in another, synchronous replication, automatic failover (<60 s). Microsoft-managed continuous backup; PITR; encryption at rest. Geo-redundant backup is part of the DR decision (G3.6).

**UI hosting:** Azure Static Web Apps (or Blob Storage + CDN if Static Web Apps is operationally complex for HMCTS).

**Secret management:** Azure Key Vault, one namespace per service. Secrets mounted at startup via Spring Cloud Azure Key Vault.

**CI/CD:** per-service Azure DevOps Pipelines or GitHub Actions (HMCTS standard). Each service has its own pipeline. Pipelines push Docker images to ACR, then deploy via Helm to AKS.

**Environment configuration:** Spring profiles (`dev`, `staging`, `production`); secrets in Key Vault. App Configuration only if runtime tuning without redeployment becomes a need.

**Observability** (log-based MVP per D7, HMCTS Crime template):

- Logback with Logstash JSON encoder; async appender.
- OpenTelemetry exports to Application Insights via OTel Collector.
- Log fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `service`, `correlation-id`, `principal-id`, `event-type`, `message`, `error-category`, `error-code`.
- Spring Boot Actuator: `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/info` (from `gradle-git-properties`), `/actuator/readiness`. The `/actuator/*` namespace is ops-restricted at the APIM layer. `/actuator/metrics` and Prometheus endpoint are not exposed at MVP (D7).
- OTel trace sampling: 100% in dev/staging; tunable in production.

**Log retention:** 30 days hot in App Insights; 90 days cold in Log Analytics archive. (Resolves PRD TBD #4.) Pre-GA review against HMCTS retention policy may extend it.

**Historical-data access:** read-only APEX bridge for 12 months after region cutover. (Resolves PRD TBD #6, partial.) After 12 months, HMCTS produces a one-shot extract; APEX read-only for that region is decommissioned. APEX retires fully when every region has passed its 12-month window. The 12-month length is pending programme confirmation.

**Scaling:** Kubernetes HPA per service. CPU/memory triggers; min 2 replicas; max replicas tuned per service after capacity stabilises.

### Deployment topology — single Azure region, multi-AZ HA

Production runs in UK South across three availability zones. DR is an open gap — see [`./architecture/gaps.md` G3.6](./architecture/gaps.md).

"Region" has two meanings in this document and the PRD:

| Concept | Meaning | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| **Azure region** | Geographic Azure deployment region. Each contains multiple availability zones (AZs) — physically separate datacentres on independent power/network. | Infrastructure: production = UK South. HA via multi-AZ within UK South. DR target region is held in G3.6. |
| **HMCTS judicial region** | NJI's per-region phased-rollout boundary — the business region used by D8 (Northern, Western, etc.). | Application tier: per-user activation flag in `auth_user_activation_flags` (FR58). No infrastructure isolation per HMCTS region. |

NFR38 ("region-isolated deployments") means the HMCTS judicial region sense — a wave in HMCTS Region B does not disrupt Region A's users. Enforced at the application tier, not by separate clusters or DNS endpoints.

#### HA topology — multi-AZ within UK South

| Component | Multi-AZ posture |
|---|---|
| **AKS** | One production cluster; node pools span all three AZs. Pod anti-affinity (`topology.kubernetes.io/zone`); min 2 replicas/service. AKS control plane is Microsoft-managed and zone-redundant. |
| **PostgreSQL Flexible Server** | Zone-redundant HA — primary + standby in different AZs, synchronous replication, automatic failover (<60 s). One instance is not a single-AZ point of failure within UK South. (G6.2 for full-region-loss residual risk; G3.6 for DR.) |
| **Azure Key Vault** | Microsoft-managed zone-redundancy in UK South (Premium tier; verify Standard). One Key Vault per service (or per service-environment). |
| **Application Insights / Log Analytics** | Microsoft-managed regional service; AZ-level redundancy is Microsoft's responsibility. One workspace shared across NJI services. |
| **Azure API Management** | Premium SKU with zone-redundancy enabled. |
| **Azure Static Web Apps (UI)** | Microsoft-managed regional service; CDN-fronted globally. |
| **Azure Container Registry** | Zone-redundant (Premium SKU). |
| **Azure Front Door / DNS** | Single DNS endpoint (e.g. `nji.production.hmcts.gov.uk`) routes to UK South ingress. Not per-HMCTS-region. |

Single-AZ failure within UK South is tolerated transparently: AKS reschedules pods; PostgreSQL fails over to the standby AZ. Full UK South region loss is the residual risk at MVP — see G6.2 and G3.6.

#### HMCTS-judicial-region rollout isolation — application tier only

| Concern | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Migrated Region B users authenticate; non-migrated Region A users do not | `auth_user_activation_flags` (FR58); `JWTFilter` rejects non-activated users |
| One region's wave deployment doesn't disrupt another | Rolling deployments per-service across the cluster; the activation flag contains the change |
| Cross-region workflow during partial rollout | Per-wave decision (Risk #1); some workflows operate mixed-mode, some are gated, some are manual |

**Consequences:** no per-HMCTS-region AKS clusters, DNS, or Key Vaults. Per-service Helm values are per-environment (`values-dev.yaml`, `values-staging.yaml`, `values-production.yaml`).

### Decision Impact Analysis

**Implementation Sequence:**

1. **Phase 0 prerequisites** — Azure subscription + UK regions; shared global PostgreSQL Flexible Server (single shared schema, per-service DB roles); HMCTS Crime SpringBoot template forked into NJI scaffolding script. *(HMCTS IdP feature confirmation deferred to pre-Phase-9; see point 8.)*
2. **Phase 0 mock authentication** — `nji-mock-auth` deployed as Spring Authorization Server-based service. Issues OIDC tokens for human user roster; **issues service tokens via `client_credentials` for `nji-payment-batch`**.
3. **Phase 0 services** — Reference Data, Authorisation, Notification — built per HMCTS starter pattern, each with own DB role + table set, OpenAPI spec, Postman collection, Helm chart. *(A shared `configuration_values` table is created by `nji-architecture` Flyway baseline; SELECT-granted to every NJI service role.)*
4. **Dev/CI environments seeded by one-off scripts** — Reference Data + a representative user roster. *(For pilot-region production seeding, the **Phase 0 Data Migration ETL** at `nji-architecture/migration/` runs operator-initiated; flagged for post-MVP refinement at G4.7.)*
5. **Phase 0 API gateway** — Azure API Management with default rate-limit policies (TBD #1 resolution).
6. **Phase 0 UI shell** — Vite + React + GOV.UK Design System scaffolding deployed to Azure Static Web Apps.
7. **Phases 1–8** — domain services per the brainstorming sequence (Judge → Absence → Vacancy → Booking → Sitting → Payment → Itinerary → MI Feed); each adds its own tables, OpenAPI spec, Postman collection, UI module. **No further APEX-data migration in Phases 1–8** — D3 caps data migration at Reference Data + Users/Roles only.
8. **Pre-Phase-9 — Real HMCTS IdP integration cutover** — confirm G1.1, G1.2 (client_credentials for batch — re-opened v2.6), G1.3. Switch staging `issuer-url` from mock auth to HMCTS IdP via Spring profile. Run reconciliation pass. Re-execute full automated test suite + per-service manual UAT scripts before opening pilot region.
9. **Phase 9+** — per-region rollout waves on production with real HMCTS IdP. App Insights retention and APEX read-only bridge activated per region.

**Cross-Component Dependencies:**

- **Authorisation service** — every `JWTFilter` calls it. Outage → outage of NJI. Mitigations: min 3 replicas; per-request-lifetime caching; circuit-breaker fail-closed (deny).
- **Reference Data tables** — read directly via SQL JOINs by every service; no caching at MVP. The Reference Data *service* outage (the API) blocks writes only; reads are served from the tables. Mitigation: PostgreSQL HA.
- **HMCTS IdP** — every authentication depends on it. IdP outage is HMCTS-wide.
- **Azure API Management** — all external client requests flow through it. Mitigation: Premium SKU with zone-redundancy.
- **PostgreSQL (one shared global instance)** — outage affects every service. Single-AZ failure tolerated by zone-redundant HA. Single-DB blast radius and full-region-loss residual risk: G6.2 and G3.6 in [`./architecture/gaps.md`](./architecture/gaps.md).

### TBDs Resolved by This Step

| # | TBD | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Rate limit policy | Azure API Management at ingress; 100 req/sec/principal default; 10 req/sec/principal for MI Feed; 200 req/sec burst |
| 2 | UI framework family | React + TypeScript + GOV.UK Design System + Vite |
| 3 | Service-to-service auth | **Two patterns at MVP**: JWT propagation (forward inbound user JWT) for user-initiated calls; OAuth `client_credentials` (via `nji-mock-auth` in non-prod; production issuer per G7.1) for the payment-processing batch service principal |
| 4 | Log retention | 30 days hot in App Insights; 90 days cold in Log Analytics archive |
| 5 | API versioning | URI prefix major versioning (`/v1/`); 6-month internal / 12-month external deprecation; `Deprecation` header per [RFC 9745](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9745); `Sunset` header per [RFC 8594](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8594) |
| 6 | Historical-data access | Read-only APEX bridge for 12 months post-region-cutover; one-shot extract thereafter |
| 7 | APEX ⇄ IdP identity-key | Email primary, employee number fallback, manual review for unmatched |

## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules

See [`./architecture/conventions.md`](./architecture/conventions.md). Patterns are enforced by code review, CI lint, contract tests, and ArchUnit fitness functions — not by a shared library.

## Project Structure & Boundaries

### Repository Strategy & List

See [`./architecture/repository-strategy.md`](./architecture/repository-strategy.md).

### Complete Project Directory Structures (per-service / UI / nji-architecture)

See [`./architecture/repo-structure.md`](./architecture/repo-structure.md).

### Architectural Boundaries

**API:** every service is exposed at `https://api.nji.{environment}.hmcts.gov.uk/{service-name}/v1/...` via APIM. Within AKS, services call each other via Kubernetes DNS. External traffic is TLS-only via APIM. No service is reachable directly from outside the cluster.

**Service:** one Spring Boot app per service; one container image; one Helm chart. One shared PostgreSQL Flexible Server with one shared schema. One Azure Key Vault namespace per service. One Application Insights workspace shared by all services (correlation IDs join logs).

**Data:**

- A service owns its tables and is the only writer (except for cross-service single-field updates per Principle 1).
- Cross-service reads: SQL JOINs on whitelisted tables.
- Cross-service writes: direct SQL on whitelisted columns (explicit `UPDATE` grants).
- FKs within the shared schema are encouraged.
- Reference Data is single-writer; other services read directly via SQL.
- Forbidden data: no bank-detail or case-level columns anywhere.
- Migrated transactional history stays in APEX; NJI tables are empty at region cutover.

**UI Boundaries:** single SPA, multiple per-domain modules; each module imports its generated API client; cross-module communication via TanStack Query cache + React Context.

**External Systems:** HMCTS IdP (every authentication); JFEPS/Liberata (outbound only via Notification → email); HMCTS Email (outbound only); APEX during build (manual UAT only); APEX during rollout (read-only for migrated users for 12 months, served separately); DA&I (inbound only, post-MVP).

### Requirements to Structure Mapping

| Capability area (FR group) | Lives in |
|---|---|
| Identity & Authorisation (FR1–FR5) | `nji-authorisation` repo + per-service `config/JWTFilter.java`, `config/AuthDetails.java`, `client/AuthorisationClient.java` |
| Foundational Data Management (FR6–FR9) | `nji-reference-data`, `nji-notification` repos + per-service direct JPA reads from the 15 Reference Data tables. **Configuration**: per-service Spring profiles + Key Vault; shared `configuration_values` table (no API) for cross-service policy values, schema-managed by `nji-architecture` Flyway baseline. |
| Judge Records & Working Patterns (FR10–FR18) | `nji-judge` repo |
| Absence Workflow (FR19–FR22) | `nji-absence` repo |
| Vacancy & Cover (FR23–FR28) | `nji-vacancy` repo. Booking marks `vacancies.filled = true` via direct DB UPDATE within Booking's transaction (per Principle 1). |
| Booking Management (FR29–FR34) | `nji-booking` repo |
| Sitting Management (FR35–FR40) | `nji-sitting` repo |
| Payment & Reconciliation (FR41–FR47) | `nji-payment` repo (batch component + reconciliation API) |
| Itineraries & Reporting (FR48–FR54) | `nji-itinerary` and `nji-mi-feed` repos |
| Platform Operations & Migration (FR55–FR61) | Cross-cutting: per-service implementations + `nji-architecture` scaffolding script |

### Cross-Cutting Concerns to File Locations

| Concern | Per-service file location |
|---|---|
| Custom `JWTFilter` + `AuthDetails` request-scoped bean (FR2) | `src/main/java/.../config/JWTFilter.java` + `config/AuthDetails.java` |
| Authorisation client called by `JWTFilter` (FR2 — NJI variance from template) | `src/main/java/.../client/AuthorisationClient.java` |
| Reference Data direct SQL access (FR7) | JPA repositories pointing at whitelisted Reference Data tables |
| Per-region scoping middleware | `src/main/java/.../config/RegionScopeFilter.java` |
| Per-region phased activation check (FR58) | Resolved in `JWTFilter` via authz path |
| Retry safety (FR45, FR30) | DB-native — `uq_*` unique constraints in `db/migration/V*__*.sql`; `@Version` on every domain entity; `@Lock(PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)` on repositories that touch related rows. No filter, no custom table, no client class. |
| [RFC 9457](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9457) problem-details error handling (FR59) | `src/main/java/.../error/GlobalExceptionHandler.java` |
| OpenAPI 3.x generation (FR59) | `src/main/java/.../config/OpenApiConfig.java` (Swagger Core); spec published as Maven artefact (`uk.gov.hmcts.nji:api-nji-{service}`) |
| Structured logging (FR60) | `src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml` + `config/CorrelationIdFilter.java` |
| Manual UAT scripts (FR61 / NFR41 revised) | `docs/uat/` per service (domain services only); not in `src/test/` |
| Forbidden-data invariants (FR47, FR54) | DB schema (no relevant columns) + DTO validation in `dto/` |

```

**Synchronous call patterns by frequency:**

- Every service → Authorisation API (per-request, request-lifetime cache).
- Every service → Reference Data tables (direct SQL; no caching at MVP).
- Booking → `vacancies.filled` direct UPDATE (in-transaction, no API roundtrip per Principle 1).
- Itinerary read-model → SQL JOIN across `judges`, `absences`, `vacancies`, `bookings`, `sittings` (single indexed query).
- MI Feed read-model → SQL JOIN across all NJI tables (single aggregate query).

### Integration Points — External

| External system | Direction | NJI service interacting | Pattern |
|---|---|---|---|
| HMCTS IdP | inbound (human authN) | Every service's `JWTFilter` validates user JWTs via JWKS; **Authorisation** maps to NJI roles | OIDC `authorization_code` for human users; JWT signature validation via JWKS (`io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt`); cross-service calls forward the user's JWT (Pattern 1). **Pre-Phase-9 dependency only** — mock auth covers Phase 0–8; cutover is a Spring profile change. |
| HMCTS IdP / Azure Workload Identity (production issuer per G7.1) | inbound (service-principal authN for batch) | `JWTFilter` validates batch service tokens via the same JWKS path | OAuth 2.0 `client_credentials` for `nji-payment-batch`; **non-prod via `nji-mock-auth` (mock_oauth_clients)**. (Pattern 2.) |
| JFEPS / Liberata | outbound | Payment + Notification | JFEPS-Excel via email to Payment Authoriser; manual upload by authoriser |
| HMCTS email | outbound | Notification | SMTP / Microsoft Graph (HMCTS standard) |
| Azure Application Insights | outbound (logs + traces) | All services | OpenTelemetry → OTel Collector → App Insights as export target |
| Azure Key Vault | inbound (secrets) | All services | Spring Cloud Azure Key Vault at startup |
| APEX (manual UAT only) | n/a | UAT users from domain services' user roles | APEX-experienced users compare side-by-side per FR61 / NFR41. No HTTP scraping, DB read, or CI hook. |
| APEX (during rollout window) | inbound (read-only for migrated users) | None — APEX served separately | Out-of-band; not an NJI integration |
| DA&I | inbound (post-MVP) | MI Feed | REST API calls; service-token authenticated |

### Data Flow — Canonical Operational Cycle (Journey 1 from PRD)

All services share one PostgreSQL DB (one schema). Each service writes its own tables; cross-service simple writes use DB role grants (Principle 1). Workflows go via API.

The cycle has two halves — user-initiated (Court User and RSU) and batch/external (payment batch + Liberata). Each has its own sequence diagram.

**User-initiated half** — see [`./architecture/sequence-diagrams/absence-to-reconciliation.md`](./architecture/sequence-diagrams/absence-to-reconciliation.md)

1. **Court User** logs an absence with cover requested — `POST /v1/absences` (FR19); ack email to the judge.
2. **RSU** approves the absence — `POST /v1/absences/{id}/approve` (FR21). Approval triggers vacancy auto-creation per **R4** — `POST /v1/vacancies` (FR23).
3. **RSU** records a fee-paid booking against the vacancy — `POST /v1/bookings` (FR29). Pessimistic row lock on the vacancy + UPDATE `vacancies.filled = true` in-transaction per **R5** (FR30); ack email (FR32).
4. **Court User** confirms the sitting after the day — `POST /v1/bookings/{id}/confirm` (FR31, FR37). Booking is now confirmed and **eligible for payment** (no synchronous payment trigger — the batch picks it up).
5. **RSU** reconciles after Liberata has paid — `POST /v1/payments/{id}/reconcile` (FR46); manual at MVP, automated reconciliation feed is post-MVP.

**Batch / external half** — see [`./architecture/sequence-diagrams/payment-batch-flow.md`](./architecture/sequence-diagrams/payment-batch-flow.md)

1. **Scheduler** (Kubernetes CronJob or Spring `@Scheduled`) triggers `nji-payment-batch` on its configured cadence.
2. The batch authenticates as a service principal via OAuth `client_credentials` against `nji-mock-auth` (non-prod; production issuer per [`./architecture/gaps.md` G7.1](./architecture/gaps.md)).
3. The batch SQL-JOINs over confirmed bookings + sittings without an existing payment record, generates the JFEPS Excel, and persists `payments` + `payment_schedules` (FR41–FR45). Bookings flagged `payment_requested`.
4. The batch calls Notification (with bearer service token) to dispatch the schedule to the configured Payment Authoriser (FR43).
5. The **Payment Authoriser** uploads the schedule to JFEPS / Liberata (out-of-band).
6. **Liberata** processes the payment and pays the judge.

### File Organisation, Development Workflow, Deployment Pipeline

See [`./architecture/repo-structure.md`](./architecture/repo-structure.md).

### Region rollout flow (Phase 9+)

Per-region production deployment is gated on:

1. All automated FR/NFR tests (unit, integration, contract, E2E) passing for the in-scope user roles.
2. **Manual UAT signed off** — APEX-experienced users for every applicable in-region role have walked the per-service UAT scripts (FR61 / NFR41 revised).
3. Phase 0 migration verified for the region (Reference Data + Users/Roles).
4. Programme sign-off (operational readiness, communication to migrating users).

Rollback path: revert the region's user activation flag (FR58) → users return to APEX.

## Architecture Validation Results

### Coherence Validation ✅

**Decision compatibility:**

- **Stack** (Java 25 + Spring Boot 4.0.6 + Gradle Groovy DSL + PostgreSQL 17 + Flyway + AKS + Azure UK + OpenTelemetry → App Insights + Key Vault + APIM, per HMCTS Crime template) — current GA, mutually compatible, Azure-native or first-party on Azure.
- **Foundational principles** (API for workflows + shared DB for simple data access; no premature optimisation; no shared runtime library) — consistent with polyrepo, per-service Spring Boot, per-service Helm, one PostgreSQL with per-service roles, per-service OpenAPI specs as Maven artefacts, and per-service boilerplate.
- **REST-first synchronous + SQL read-model federation** — workflows go via API; read models query the shared DB directly. No event bus.
- **Mock-first authentication + OIDC for humans + two inter-service patterns (JWT propagation, service-principal `client_credentials` for batch)** — issuer-agnostic OIDC contract; mock-to-real cutover is a configuration change.
- **GOV.UK Design System + WCAG 2.2 AA + axe-core** — GDS components are built to WCAG 2.2 AA.

**Pattern consistency:** Step 5 patterns match Step 4 decisions — DB naming (`snake_case`, plural tables, `uuid` PKs); API naming (`camelCase` JSON, plural resources, `/v1/`, RFC 9457 problem-details, ISO 8601); Java package layout (`uk.gov.hmcts.nji.{service}.{layer}`); communication (typed clients, correlation-ID propagation, native DB retry safety).

**Structure alignment:** per-service repos enable phased rollout and independent deployment; per-environment Helm values + zone-redundant AKS provide HA for NFR34/NFR35/NFR37; NFR38 is satisfied at the app tier via FR58; Postman collections per phase satisfy NFR42; `nji-architecture` holds ADRs and scaffolding without runtime coupling; `nji-mock-auth` is isolated so production never references it.

No contradictions found.

### Requirements Coverage Validation ✅

- **Functional Requirements Coverage (FR1–FR61)** — see [`./architecture/functional-requirements-coverage.md`](./architecture/functional-requirements-coverage.md).
- **Non-Functional Requirements Coverage (NFR1–NFR42)** — see [`./architecture/non-functional-requirements-coverage.md`](./architecture/non-functional-requirements-coverage.md).

All 61 FRs and 42 NFRs have explicit architectural support.

### Implementation Readiness Validation ✅

All 7 architecture-phase TBDs from the PRD are resolved (see *TBDs Resolved by This Step*).

**Structure:** 14 repos with per-repo trees; per-service standard layout to file level; UI repo with per-domain modules; architecture repo with ADRs/scaffolding/aggregated specs; isolated mock-auth repo; integration points mapped; requirements-to-structure mapping covers all 9 FR capability areas.

**Patterns:** naming, structure, format, communication, and process conventions defined with examples. Enforcement: CI lint, ArchUnit, Spectral, Pact, code review checklist.

### Documented Gaps

See [`./architecture/gaps.md`](./architecture/gaps.md). Critical gaps: none — no gap blocks implementation.

### Assumptions

See [`./architecture/assumptions.md`](./architecture/assumptions.md).

### Architecture Readiness Assessment

**Status: READY WITH DOCUMENTED GAPS. Confidence: High.**

All checklist items pass. No critical gaps block implementation. Mock-first authentication reclassifies G1.1, G1.2, G1.3 from Phase 0 blockers to pre-Phase-9 prerequisites. Phase 0 HMCTS dependencies reduce from 5 to 2 (G1.4 starter, G1.5 email). Risk #6 (HMCTS IdP integration timing) is mitigated.

**Why high confidence:**

- Aligned with PRD's locked decisions; the 7 architecture-phase TBDs are resolved without contradiction.
- The two foundational principles and the no-shared-library rule are applied consistently through Steps 3–6.
- Step 5 pattern definitions are concrete and CI-enforceable (Spotless, ArchUnit, Spectral, Pact, axe-core).
- Polyrepo structure matches phased rollout (D8) and per-service deployment independence (NFR40).
- Mock-first authentication removes the HMCTS IdP roadmap from the Phase 0–8 critical path.

**Strengths:**

- **Simplification** — event bus, shared library, and monorepo all rejected.
- **Multi-AZ HA in UK South** — single-AZ failure is tolerated transparently. HMCTS-region rollout isolation (NFR38) is at the app tier (FR58), not per-region infrastructure.
- **No shared library** — cross-cutting concerns are per-service, removing redeployment coupling.
- **API-as-Product enforcement** — versioning, OpenAPI, RFC 9457 problem-details, RFC 9745 + RFC 8594 deprecation signalling — all CI-enforced.
- **Manual UAT in the rollout gate** — `docs/uat/` per service; APEX-experienced users sign off per role per region as the wave-cutover gate.
- **Mock-first authentication** decouples the build from the HMCTS IdP roadmap.

**Post-MVP enhancements (not blocking):** Mermaid / C4 diagrams in `nji-architecture/diagrams/`; sample ADRs; per-service OpenAPI snippets; service mesh (only if observability or mTLS demands grow); caching (only if measurement shows the need); App Configuration for runtime tuning.

### Implementation Handoff

**For AI agents:**

- Follow the architectural decisions in Steps 3–6.
- Use the patterns in [`./architecture/conventions.md`](./architecture/conventions.md) across all 11 services and the UI.
- Apply the two foundational principles: (1) API for workflows; shared DB for simple data access; (2) no premature optimisation. No shared runtime library.
- Per-service work happens in the service's own repo. Cross-service work happens via API contracts.
- Phase 0–8 authentication is `nji-mock-auth` only (`authorization_code` for humans; `client_credentials` for the payment batch). Real HMCTS IdP starts at the pre-Phase-9 cutover.
- Raise gaps via PR against this document.

**First implementation steps:**

1. Confirm Phase 0 prerequisites: Azure subscription + UK regions; HMCTS Java/Spring Boot starter; HMCTS Email transport.
2. Build the NJI scaffolding script at `nji-architecture/scaffolding/nji-scaffold.sh`, layered on the HMCTS starter, with NJI conventions baked in.
3. Ship `nji-mock-auth` (Spring Authorization Server; refuses to start with `production` profile; supports `authorization_code` and `client_credentials`).
4. Ship the three Phase 0 cross-cutting services: Reference Data, Authorisation, Notification. The shared `configuration_values` table is created by `nji-architecture`'s Flyway baseline. In parallel, build the Phase 0 Data Migration ETL at `nji-architecture/migration/` to load Reference Data + Users/Roles via the APIs.
5. Deploy Phase 0 to dev. Exercise API-as-Product standards (versioning, OpenAPI, RFC 9457 problem-details, deprecation signalling). Validate Postman collections. Run automated tests. Manual UAT starts in Phase 1.
6. Resolve programme-management dependencies before Phase 9.
7. Begin Phase 1 (Judge service). Expand across Phases 2–8 in dependency order.
8. Pre-Phase-9: real HMCTS IdP cutover — verify G1.1, G1.2, G1.3; switch staging `issuer-url` to HMCTS IdP (and resolve production service-principal issuer per G7.1); rehearse cutover; re-run automated tests + manual UAT against real IdP before opening the pilot region.

## Changelog

See [`./architecture/changelog.md`](./architecture/changelog.md). **Latest:** v2.8 — DR (disaster recovery) consolidated as an open gap. All DR scope, design, region choice, posture, geo-redundant backup configuration, AKS DR Helm values, DNS failover and RTO/RPO detail moved into [`./architecture/gaps.md` G3.6](./architecture/gaps.md); architecture documents reference the gap rather than repeating mitigation/scope detail. Earlier: v2.7 — RFC citations updated to current RFCs (RFC 9457 problem-details, RFC 9745 `Deprecation`, RFC 9110 `Retry-After`); External References appendix added with verifiable datatracker links.
