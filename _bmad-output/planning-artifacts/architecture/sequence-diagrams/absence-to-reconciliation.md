# Absence → Vacancy → Booking → Sitting → Reconciliation

Sequence diagram of the user-initiated RAM Pathfinder operational cycle: a Court User logs an absence for a salaried JOH; the absence triggers a vacancy; RSU fills the vacancy with a fee-paid booking; the Court User confirms the sitting (marking it ready for payment); RSU reconciles the payment after the batch and external systems complete.

Five phases, each driven by a user action. Phases are colour-tinted in the diagram.

## Not in this diagram

User-initiated activities only. The following sit between Phase 4 and Phase 5 but are not drawn because they are not user-initiated:

- **Payment-processing batch** — picks up bookings with `status = ready_for_payment`, SQL-JOINs across confirmed bookings + sittings, generates the JFEPS Excel, persists `ram_payments` + `ram_payment_schedules`, dispatches via email to the Payment Authoriser. Runs on a schedule (e.g. end-of-week). See [`./payment-batch-flow.md`](./payment-batch-flow.md).
- **Payment Authoriser → JFEPS / Liberata** — authoriser reviews the email and uploads to Liberata via the existing JFEPS workflow. Out-of-band.
- **Liberata processing** — Liberata pays the fee-paid JOH. External system.

## Cross-cutting steps omitted

Apply to every Court / RSU → service call:

- All UI → service calls flow through Azure API Management.
- Each service's `JWTFilter` validates the JWT signature against HMCTS IdP's JWKS before the controller runs.
- The same `JWTFilter` calls `POST /authz/check` against `ram-authorisation` for roles + jurisdiction + Region/Area scope + activation flag (FR57).
- Cross-service calls forward the user's JWT.

## Phase summary

| Phase | Driver | Architectural rule | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Absence logged | Court User | Validation (FR15-style: ticket-type + start date required) | Absence record created (status: pending); ack email to salaried JOH |
| 2 — Absence approved | RSU | **R4** — approval triggers vacancy creation | Vacancy created (status: needs-allocation) |
| 3 — Booking created | RSU | **R5** — booking creation marks the linked vacancy as filled in the same transaction (persistence detail in *Data Architecture*) | Booking persisted; vacancy filled; ack email to fee-paid JOH |
| 4 — Sitting confirmed | Court User | State transition; record marked ready for the payment batch | Booking status = `ready_for_payment` (the batch picks this up later) |
| *(out of scope)* | *(none — batch / external)* | *Routine payment-processing batch + Liberata processing* | *JFEPS Excel generated, dispatched, uploaded; JOH paid* |
| 5 — Reconciliation | RSU | Manual at MVP (automated reconciliation feed from Liberata is post-MVP) | `ram_payment_reconciliations.status = matched` |
